        "<b>Cryptocurrency Transactions:</b> Once a cryptocurrency transfer is submitted to a cryptocurrency network, the transaction will be unconfirmed and remain in a pending state for a period of time sufficient to confirmation of the transaction by the cryptocurrency network. A cryptocurrency transfer is not complete while it is in a pending state. Pending cryptocurrency transfers that are initiated from a Quantex Account may reflect a pending transaction status and may not be available to you for use on the Quantex platform or otherwise while the transaction is pending. <br /><br />When you or a third party sends cryptocurrency to a Quantex Account from an external wallet or account not hosted on Quantex, the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of sufficient network or miner’s fees in order for the transaction to be successful. Insufficient network fees may cause a transfer to remain in a pending state outside of Quantex’s control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions. By initiating a transfer to Quantex, you attest that you are transacting in a cryptocurrency that is identified as trading on the Quantex Website which conforms to the particular Quantex wallet into which funds are directed. Quantex incurs no obligation whatsoever with regard to unsupported digital currency sent to a Quantex Account or supported cryptocurrency sent to an incompatible cryptocurrency wallet address. Erroneously transmitted funds will be lost. We recommend customers send a small amount of cryptocurrency as a test prior to initiating a send of a significant amount of supported cryptocurrency. <br /><br />When you send cryptocurrency from your Quantex Account to an external address, such transfers are executed at your instruction by Quantex. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. Quantex shall bear no liability or responsibility in the event you enter an incorrect blockchain destination address. We do not guarantee the identity or value received by a recipient of a transfer initiated by you. Cryptocurrency transfers cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant cryptocurrency network, although they may be in a pending state, and designated accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network operators. Quantex does not control the cryptocurrency network and makes no guarantees that a cryptocurrency transfer will be confirmed by the network. <br /><br />We may refuse to process or cancel any pending transfers as required by law or any court or other authority to which Quantex is subject in any jurisdiction. Additionally, we may require you to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction before permitting you to use further Quantex Services and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain volume limits. <br /><br /> We may allow you to initiate a cryptocurrency transfer to a Quantex customer by designating that customer’s email address. If you initiate a cryptocurrency transfer to an email address, and the recipient does not have an existing Quantex Account, we will invite the recipient to open a Quantex Account. If the recipient does not open a Quantex Account within 60 days, we will return the relevant cryptocurrency to your Quantex Account. <br /><br />If Quantex elects to offer recurring transaction availability, and you initiate recurring transactions, you authorize us to initiate recurring electronic payments in accordance with your selected cryptocurrency or payments, such as recurring automated clearing house (ACH) debit or credit entries from or to your linked bank account. Your recurring transactions will occur in identical, periodic installments, based on your period selection (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), until either you or Quantex cancels the recurring order. If you select a bank account as your payment method for a recurring transaction, and such transaction falls on a weekend or holiday, or after bank business hours, the ACH credit or debit will be executed on the next business day, although the cryptocurrency fees at the time of the regularly-scheduled transaction will apply. If your bank is unable to process any electronic ACH debit entry, we will notify you of cancellation of the transaction and may avail itself of remedies set forth in these Terms to recover any amount owed to Quantex. You agree to notify Quantex in writing of any changes in your linked bank account information prior to a recurring transaction.

      contentList: [
        "<b>Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period.</b> Please contact Quantex first! Quantex wants to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings, if possible. If you have a dispute with Quantex, then you should contact Quantex and a ticket number will be assigned. Quantex will attempt to resolve your dispute internally as soon as possible. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in any legal proceeding). You and Quantex agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms. <br /><br /> In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to assert a legal claim against Quantex, then you agree to set forth the basis of such claim in writing in a “Notice of Claim,” as a form of prior notice to Quantex. The Notice of Claim must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (2) set forth the specific relief sought, (3) provide the original ticket number, and (4) include your Quantex account email. The Notice of Claim should be submitted to an email address or hyperlink provided in your correspondence with Quantex. After you have provided the Notice of Claim to Quantex, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim may be submitted by either Quantex or you to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Section, below. For the avoidance of doubt, the submission of a dispute to Quantex for resolution internally and the delivery of a Notice of Claim to Quantex are prerequisites to commencement of an arbitration proceeding (or any other legal proceeding). During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Quantex shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.",
        "<b>Agreement to Arbitrate and Governing Law.</b> You and Quantex Operators agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Quantex (and/or Quantex Operators) arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Quantex (and/or Quantex Operators) as a user of Quantex Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory final and binding individual (not class) arbitration, except as set forth below under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Quantex Operators further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including without limitation any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate, or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including, if applicable, attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief in favour of anyone but the parties to the arbitration. The arbitration provisions set forth in this Section will survive termination of these Terms. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 32 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Quantex are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in Alameda County in California, and you and Quantex each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.",
        "<b>Arbitration Rules.</b> The arbitration shall be subject to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration rules (the “AAA rules”) when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county, city (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement. To the extent the location of the arbitration hearing is more than 100 miles from a location of Quantex offices, Quantex reserves the right to appear by video conference to the fullest extent permitted by law.",

If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.",

The existence of the arbitration, any nonpublic information provided in the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration (together, the “Confidential Information”) shall not be disclosed to any non-party except the tribunal, the AAA, the parties, their counsel, experts, witnesses, accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and any other person necessary to the conduct of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that disclosure may be required to fulfill a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings. This confidentiality provision shall survive termination of these Terms and of any arbitration brought pursuant to these Terms.",
        "<b>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.</b> The arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.",
        "<b>Class Action Waiver.</b> You and Quantex agree that any claims relating to these Terms or to your relationship with Quantex as a user of Quantex Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) shall be brought against the other party in an arbitration on an individual basis only and not as a plaintiff or class member in a purported class or representative action. You and Quantex further agree to waive any right for such claims to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action, to the extent permissible by applicable law. Combining or consolidating individual arbitrations into a single arbitration is not permitted without the consent of all parties, including Quantex.",

You hereby consent and agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that your understanding of this Section is up to date. Subject to the applicable law, your continued use of your Quantex account shall be deemed to be your acceptance of any modifications to Section X regarding the parties’ Agreement to Arbitrate.
